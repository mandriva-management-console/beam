"""Utilities to NET comm. with the LRS binaries

LRS comm is based on PMRPC (Poor man's RPC). See the LRS code for the draft.

Basically:
    - GUI is listing and CLI is sending, based on tockens exchange.
    - CLI send command (one keyword, several args).
    - GUI send back acks (one keyword)
    - keywords and args are encoded as "tockens"

    One tocken is:
        - one ui32 (4 bytes, Little Endian) giving the length of the tocken,
        - (lenght) bytes containing the tocken (formerly a string)

    One command is:
        - one tocken containing the keyword,
        - one ui32 (4 bytes, Little Endian) giving the number of args,
        - several tockens, one per arg.

    Exemple (from the GUI ppoint of view):
        RC: |init_backup|
        RA: |/dev/hda1|/home/LRS/noiraude_2007-07-05_18:19:44/P1|192712|84706|
/home/nicolas/Devs/GhostKiller/lrs-bin/revobin/image_e2fs|
        S:  |OK|
        RC: |refresh_backup_progress|
        RA: |0|
        S:  |OK|
        RC: |refresh_backup_progress|
        RA: |818176|
        RC: |close|
        S:  |OK|
